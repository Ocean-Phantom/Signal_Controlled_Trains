[mod-messages]
SCT_Delivery_Timeout_Message=A __1__ for [train=__2__] heading to [train-stop=__3__] has timed out. It may be necessary to change this train's schedule to maintain proper insertion order for future deliveries. This can be cause by excessive travel/loading/unloading times, no-pathing or the destination stop being disabled or becoming full. This may also be caused by Trains or Train Stops becoming invalid.
